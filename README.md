# stringexchange-flask

Stringexchange-flask is a Flask-based implementation of the string exchange project.

It accepts string submissions at the root url, then directs the user to /display upon submission, where a previously submitted string is displayed. The user can then choose to "Wipe this string from existence." or "Leave it for posterity!".
